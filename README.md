# Udacity-projects

These projects were completed as part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.  The projects contained some pre-written code along with data and questions that had to be answered.  I then had to add additional code, analyze the data and complete the questions.  All these projects were graded by someone at Udacity, and usually took 2-3 submissions until all requirements were satisfied.

This program was divided into two parts.  Part 1 projects were:
1. Boston Housing (Intro to ML)
2. Finding Donors (Supervised ML)
3. Customer Segments (Unsupervised ML)
